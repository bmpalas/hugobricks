# Hi, I'm Brandon Palas

I'm a lifelong artist, with over a decade of experience working in comics and illustration. This site collects a huge portion of my work from throughout my life. Currently, I'm intermittently working on my sci-fi adventure comic [Bastard Planet](https://www.bastardplanet.com), and I'm learning to tattoo.
